This means that if you want a finished trifold brochure that folds to 9.5” x 3.69”, the unfolded size would be 9.5” x 11”.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What should be inside my brochure?</strong></p>\r\n<p>1. <strong>Cover</strong> - A central image that immediately conveys what your product or service has to offer. Include your company logo and name so customers make the association.</p>\r\n<p>2. <strong>High Resolution Images </strong>- Use 350 dpi resolution images on your brochure design. This resolution ensures the photo won’t be blurry upon printing.</p>\r\n<p>3. <strong>Features and Benefits</strong> - The copy should elaborate on the main selling points of your product or service. Break it down in a list format or several sections for easy reading.</p>\r\n<p>3. <strong>Call to Action</strong> - Include discount coupons or promos in the brochure to drive traffic to your store or online e-commerce site.</p>\r\n<p>5. <strong>Contact Information</strong> - Don’t forget to place all your company’s contact information, such as a telephone number, address, email address, and website for the customer’s reference.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How much copy and images should I include on my brochure?</strong></p>\r\n<p>The most eye-catching brochures are highly visual and use images to guide the reader through the content. A photo or illustration in each panel helps introduce or show the content in detail. Copy should be as short as possible and sustain the reader’s focus on your main topic.

This means that 70 lb. paper is the thinnest and lightest, while 100 lb. is the thickest among the paper options. The 10 pt. cardstock is also lightweight but still slightly thicker than the paper stock materials. </p>',5.00,NULL),

Include your company logo and name so customers make the association.</p>\r\n<p>2. <strong>High Resolution Images </strong>- Use 350 dpi resolution images on your brochure design.

This means that if you want a finished trifold brochure that folds to 9.5” x 3.69”, the unfolded size would be 9.5” x 11”.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What should be inside my brochure?</strong></p>\r\n<p>1. <strong>Cover</strong> - A central image that immediately conveys what your product or service has to offer. Include your company logo and name so customers make the association.</p>\r\n<p>2. <strong>High Resolution Images </strong>- Use 350 dpi resolution images on your brochure design. This resolution ensures the photo won’t be blurry upon printing.</p>\r\n<p>3. <strong>Features and Benefits</strong> - The copy should elaborate on the main selling points of your product or service. Break it down in a list format or several sections for easy reading.</p>\r\n<p>3. <strong>Call to Action</strong> - Include discount coupons or promos in the brochure to drive traffic to your store or online e-commerce site.</p>\r\n<p>5. <strong>Contact Information</strong> - Don’t forget to place all your company’s contact information, such as a telephone number, address, email address, and website for the customer’s reference.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How much copy and images should I include on my brochure?</strong></p>\r\n<p>The most eye-catching brochures are highly visual and use images to guide the reader through the content. A photo or illustration in each panel helps introduce or show the content in detail. Copy should be as short as possible and sustain the reader’s focus on your main topic. For more information, check out our guide on <a href=\"https://www.uprinting.com/blog/how-to-design-brochure/\">how to design brochures</a>. </p>\r\n<p><strong>What does the number in the paper material name indicate?</strong></p>\r\n<p>The number before the paper and cardstock material indicates its weight. This means that 70 lb. paper is the thinnest and lightest, while 100 lb. is the thickest among the paper options. The 10 pt. cardstock is also lightweight but still slightly thicker than the paper stock materials. </p>',5.00,'storage/art_uploads/15561662420.png'),

Standard postcard printing is an affordable way of informing current and potential customers on your brand’s latest deals, promos, or products. Its impact begins in the homes of your consumers when they receive their postcard in the mail.</p>\r\n<p>Promotional postcards compel them to check out what you’re announcing and visit your store to check out the advertised offer.</p>\r\n<h2>What Are the Advantages of Each Paper Material?</h2>\r\n<p>We offer several cardstock and coating options that protect your postcard design from damage during mailing or on display.</p>\r\n<h3>10 pt. Cardstock</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"list-style: disc;\">The lightest and most flexible option</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"list-style: disc;\">Recommended for handing out in store or at specialized events </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"list-style: disc;\">Comes in protective gloss or smooth matte </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>14 pt. Cardstock</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"list-style: disc;\">The standard material used for other thick promotional products such as business cards</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"list-style: disc;\">Sturdy enough to handle high-quality double-sided printing & multiple handlings</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"list-style: disc;\">Available in shiny gloss and elegant matte coating </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>16 pt. Cardstock</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"list-style: disc;\">Additional durability gives an upscale feel</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"list-style: disc;\">Double-sided gloss protects it from wear, tear, & other external damage</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"list-style: disc;\">Matte finish leads customers to reading lengthier text</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>17 pt.

Here are some of our standard postcard sizes that are guaranteed to make an immediate impression:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"list-style: disc;\"><strong>4\" x 6\"</strong> is small enough to make a straightforward and easy to read announcement. It’s also easy to keep and qualifies as USPS First-Class mail. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"list-style: disc;\"><strong>5\" x 7\"</strong> stands out against the smaller, standard postcards sent as personal mail. Its width allows for the right balance among several images and compelling copy. Perfect for promoting a new business or product line.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"list-style: disc;\"><strong>5.5\" x 8.5\"</strong> has more than enough space for an image-heavy or extremely visual design. Recommended for postcards announcing a sale or special deal available in store or under a limited time period. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"list-style: disc;\"><strong>6\" x 9\"</strong> is the biggest option among the popular postcard sizes. Suitable for postcards with more than three images or the need to relay information in a straightforward, visual manner. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Do You Offer Direct Mailing?</h2>\r\n<p>We save you from the hassle of distributing your postcards yourself with a <a href=\"https://www.uprinting.com/mailing-service.html\" target=\"_blank\">direct mail service</a> which only adds 2-3 business days to your turnaround time. No need to worry about stuffing envelopes, addressing each to customers, then making the trip to USPS. We take care of your order every step of the way—from when you print standard postcards, sending you a free file check to avoid errors, then delivering each item to your customer’s doorstep.</p>\r\n<h2>Q&A</h2>\r\n<p><strong>When can I expect to receive my postcard order?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Our online calculator lets you choose a preferred printing turnaround, usually as fast as one business day. Printing turnaround refers to the number of days it takes to produce the postcards. To find out when your postcards will arrive, input your ZIP code after selecting “Estimate Shipping Cost and Delivery Date” on our online calculator.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Which is the most durable cardstock among the materials available?</strong></p>\r\n<p>The thicker cardstocks are able to withstand the potential damage from the mailing process. The <strong>14 pt. cardstock</strong> is the most popular option, but the <strong>16 pt.</strong> and <strong>17 pt. </strong>have a more substantial weight. We highly recommend the <strong>16 pt. cardstock gloss</strong> for those planning to delivery a large quantity of postcards to several locations.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How do I create an effective postcard design? </strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"list-style: disc;\"><strong>Keep things short and sweet.</strong> People want information that’s easy to digest and understand. The copy on your postcard should compel customers to read but not lose their attention. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"list-style: disc;\"><strong>Call your customers to action.</strong> Give them a reason to visit your store, website, or to try a new product. This action can convert your postcard marketing into significant sales.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"list-style: disc;\"><strong>Communicate the benefit you have to offer.</strong> Resist the urge to list down product features. Instead, show them that your latest restaurant promotion will save them money (50% off) or how a real estate location can lower their cost of living in the long run. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"list-style: disc;\"><strong>Utilize large images & bright colors</strong>. Your postcard needs to stand out against every other marketing promotion. Make sure the central image is compelling enough to draw attention and that the colors lead the customer right into your headline and contact information<strong>. </strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>To find out how else you can utilize custom postcards, check out this <a href=\"https://www.uprinting.com/blog/custom-postcards-design-applications-printing-tips/\" target=\"_blank\">article on designing postcards effectively</a>. </p>\r\n<p><strong>What is the advantage of getting a free file check? <br></strong></p>\r\n<p>Our free file check lets you look at the design before it is sent for printing.

Include your company logo and name so customers make the association.</p>\r\n<p>2. <strong>High Resolution Images </strong>- Use 350 dpi resolution images on your brochure design. This resolution ensures the photo won’t be blurry upon printing.</p>\r\n<p>3. <strong>Features and Benefits</strong> - The copy should elaborate on the main selling points of your product or service. Break it down in a list format or several sections for easy reading.</p>\r\n<p>3. <strong>Call to Action</strong> - Include discount coupons or promos in the brochure to drive traffic to your store or online e-commerce site.</p>\r\n<p>5. <strong>Contact Information</strong> - Don’t forget to place all your company’s contact information, such as a telephone number, address, email address, and website for the customer’s reference.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How much copy and images should I include on my brochure?</strong></p>\r\n<p>The most eye-catching brochures are highly visual and use images to guide the reader through the content. A photo or illustration in each panel helps introduce or show the content in detail. Copy should be as short as possible and sustain the reader’s focus on your main topic.

This means that 70 lb. paper is the thinnest and lightest, while 100 lb. is the thickest among the paper options. The 10 pt. cardstock is also lightweight but still slightly thicker than the paper stock materials. </p>',5.00,'storage/art_uploads/15573365900.png'),

This means that if you want a finished trifold brochure that folds to 9.5” x 3.69”, the unfolded size would be 9.5” x 11”.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What should be inside my brochure?</strong></p>\r\n<p>1. <strong>Cover</strong> - A central image that immediately conveys what your product or service has to offer. Include your company logo and name so customers make the association.</p>\r\n<p>2. <strong>High Resolution Images </strong>- Use 350 dpi resolution images on your brochure design. This resolution ensures the photo won’t be blurry upon printing.</p>\r\n<p>3. <strong>Features and Benefits</strong> - The copy should elaborate on the main selling points of your product or service. Break it down in a list format or several sections for easy reading.</p>\r\n<p>3. <strong>Call to Action</strong> - Include discount coupons or promos in the brochure to drive traffic to your store or online e-commerce site.</p>\r\n<p>5. <strong>Contact Information</strong> - Don’t forget to place all your company’s contact information, such as a telephone number, address, email address, and website for the customer’s reference.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How much copy and images should I include on my brochure?</strong></p>\r\n<p>The most eye-catching brochures are highly visual and use images to guide the reader through the content. A photo or illustration in each panel helps introduce or show the content in detail. Copy should be as short as possible and sustain the reader’s focus on your main topic. For more information, check out our guide on <a href=\"https://www.uprinting.com/blog/how-to-design-brochure/\">how to design brochures</a>. </p>\r\n<p><strong>What does the number in the paper material name indicate?</strong></p>\r\n<p>The number before the paper and cardstock material indicates its weight. This means that 70 lb. paper is the thinnest and lightest, while 100 lb. is the thickest among the paper options. The 10 pt. cardstock is also lightweight but still slightly thicker than the paper stock materials. </p>','products/UP_Brochures_Main_Image[1]_450x450.jpg',-1,5.00,NULL,0.00,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,5.00,'lbs',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2019-05-08 17:35:15'),

Business flyer printing has been used for decades to inform both loyal and potential customers of retail, real estate, and restaurant products and services. Promotional flyers are also used to announce major changes such as a new store branch or address change. They are also easy to hand out in high foot traffic areas, letting you target specific audiences.</p>\r\n<h2>How to Choose the Best Paper Type</h2>\r\n<p>We offer three kinds of paper stock and two cardstock options. The choice will depend on your preferred material thickness and the distribution method of the marketing flyers.</p>\r\n<h3>Paper Stock Options</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"list-style: disc;\"><strong>70 lb. paper </strong>is the thinnest paper type, with the same feel and weight as notebook paper. Recommended for those that will hand out bulk flyer quantities in high traffic areas. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"list-style: disc;\"><strong>80 lb. paper </strong>has the same weight as magazine paper, providing more durability than 70 lb. paper. The best choice for those who want the flexibility and ease of lightweight paper but with additional durability.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"list-style: disc;\"><strong>100 lb. paper </strong>is the thickest paper option available and able to withstand handling. It has the same thickness as coffee table book paper, making it suitable for handing out at small events. Customers can keep the flyer for future reference.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Cardstock Choices</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"list-style: disc;\"><strong>10 pt. cardstock </strong>is much thicker than paper but still foldable. This material is normally used for postcards and greeting cards. Recommended for business flyers to be given away at store openings and small conventions. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"list-style: disc;\"><strong>14 pt. cardstock</strong> is our sturdiest and toughest material available. Its weight is normally seen on door hangers and postcards that are put on display. Works best for flyers that will be displayed at cash registers or in waiting rooms. We also recommend this material for business flyers that aim for a professional and premium look. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>What to Expect With Our Coating Options</h2>\r\n<p>Your coating option determines the finish and feel of your business flyer design. Here’s a quick guide on what to expect from the four available options.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"list-style: disc;\"><strong>Matte</strong> gives your custom business flyers a smooth, subdued finish. It works best on designs that balance large images with lengthier text.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"list-style: disc;\"><strong>Gloss</strong> adds that extra pop to your flyer design’s colors. Expect an added sheen to the surface that reflects under a light. It is similar to the finish seen on magazines.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"list-style: disc;\"><strong>High gloss UV </strong>is shinier than gloss and provides the highest reflectivity. It is able to withstand frequent handling and is resistant to abrasion, thus recommended for flyers that will be distributed outdoors and at large events. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"list-style: disc;\"><strong>Uncoated </strong>is available for our 70 lb. paper and 14 pt. cardstock. No additional shine or touch is added to make the surface writable with a pen or marker. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>For more information, check out our <a href=\"https://www.uprinting.com/help-stock.html\" target=\"_blank\">comprehensive guide</a> on paper, cardstock, and coating options.</p>\r\n<p>Whether you’re opening a new store, announcing a real estate company development or launching a product line, business flyers let you communicate immediately to your target market.

It lasts longer compared to the others with a weight similar to standard business cards and luxurious looking invitations.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What does the \"printed side\" indicate on the online calculator?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Flyers are normally read from one side but you can add more information by printing on the front and the back. Printing on both sides lets you maximize the space available and expound on lengthier information such as a product line or several services.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How can I effectively design my business flyer?</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"list-style: disc;\"><strong>Keep the design focused without losing its appeal. </strong>The overall look shouldn’t be too busy and should lead readers to your main image and headline. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"list-style: disc;\"><strong>Use a readable font and high resolution images. </strong>Flyers are quickly scanned so a pixelated image and a confusing font will lose a customer’s interest.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"list-style: disc;\"><strong>Get straight to the point. </strong>Your announcement or discount offer should be immediately seen. Use a call-to-action to entice customers and to build interest in your brand.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Does the printing time include shipment to my address?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Printing refers to the number of days for producing your order. We can print your order in 1 business day. To find out when your flyers will arrive, input your ZIP code after selecting “Estimate Shipping Cost and Delivery Date” on our online calculator. </p>\r\n<p><strong>What is the advantage of adding bundling to my business flyers order?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Bundling seals your flyer order in sets of 25, 50, or 250 pieces.

Unlike gloss and high gloss, it does not glare or reflect light. It is recommended for those who need a rustic or subdued look on their design. <strong>Gloss coating</strong> makes the design shine and reflects the light. As a result, colors appear more vibrant and stand out under low light. <strong>High gloss UV coating</strong> has a shinier finish than gloss and can withstand outdoor elements.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What is the difference between paper and BOPP material?</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Paper is the best choice to print custom stickers that will only be used indoors and will have no exposure to water and other outdoor elements. BOPP is applied on consumable products that require refrigeration, such as water and beer bottles. Clear, white, and silver metallic BOPP are all waterproof, oil resistant, and tearproof.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Will my stickers come bundled and packaged upon delivery?</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Your personalized stickers can be bundled. On our online calculator, go to “Bundling” and select “Shrink Wrapping.” This ensures your orders are organized and protected during shipment at a very low cost.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Does the printing time also include the delivery time?</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The printing time indicates the number of business days for producing your order.

No need to worry about stuffing envelopes, addressing each to customers, then making the trip to USPS. We take care of your order every step of the way—from when you print standard postcards, sending you a free file check to avoid errors, then delivering each item to your customer’s doorstep.</p>\r\n<h2>Q&A</h2>\r\n<p><strong>When can I expect to receive my postcard order?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Our online calculator lets you choose a preferred printing turnaround, usually as fast as one business day. Printing turnaround refers to the number of days it takes to produce the postcards. To find out when your postcards will arrive, input your ZIP code after selecting “Estimate Shipping Cost and Delivery Date” on our online calculator.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Which is the most durable cardstock among the materials available?</strong></p>\r\n<p>The thicker cardstocks are able to withstand the potential damage from the mailing process. The <strong>14 pt. cardstock</strong> is the most popular option, but the <strong>16 pt.</strong> and <strong>17 pt. </strong>have a more substantial weight. We highly recommend the <strong>16 pt. cardstock gloss</strong> for those planning to delivery a large quantity of postcards to several locations.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How do I create an effective postcard design? </strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"list-style: disc;\"><strong>Keep things short and sweet.</strong> People want information that’s easy to digest and understand. The copy on your postcard should compel customers to read but not lose their attention. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"list-style: disc;\"><strong>Call your customers to action.</strong> Give them a reason to visit your store, website, or to try a new product. This action can convert your postcard marketing into significant sales.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"list-style: disc;\"><strong>Communicate the benefit you have to offer.</strong> Resist the urge to list down product features. Instead, show them that your latest restaurant promotion will save them money (50% off) or how a real estate location can lower their cost of living in the long run. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"list-style: disc;\"><strong>Utilize large images & bright colors</strong>. Your postcard needs to stand out against every other marketing promotion. Make sure the central image is compelling enough to draw attention and that the colors lead the customer right into your headline and contact information<strong>. </strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>To find out how else you can utilize custom postcards, check out this <a href=\"https://www.uprinting.com/blog/custom-postcards-design-applications-printing-tips/\" target=\"_blank\">article on designing postcards effectively</a>. </p>\r\n<p><strong>What is the advantage of getting a free file check? <br></strong></p>\r\n<p>Our free file check lets you look at the design before it is sent for printing.

Plastic business card printing provides both an attractive and practical solution to this idea. The material is sturdy enough to withstand tears and to resist to damage from water. Our three plastic types—clear, frosted, and white—offer unique and luxurious looking surfaces that will stun anyone who comes across your business cards.</p>\r\n<h2>Three Dynamic and Durable Plastic Materials</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"list-style: disc;\"><strong>Clear plastic business cards </strong>are printed on a transparent, see-through material that beg you to take a closer look. The clear finish also adds emphasis to your company name, logo, and contact details. <br> <br>Note: All clear plastic cards come with a protective film to prevent the material from getting scratched during shipping.Upon receiving your order, remove the film to reveal the plastic\'s see-through appearance.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"list-style: disc;\"><strong>Frosted plastic business cards</strong> use a semi-transparent material that still appears clean and futuristic. The plastic\'s frosted finish provides a more distinct but also glass-like background to your design.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"list-style: disc;\"><strong>White plastic business cards</strong> come in an opaque material that suits designs dependent on bright and bold hues. The background is a perfect contrast to daring shades such as red and orange or dark hues such as black or navy.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><strong>A Couple Design Notes:</strong></p>\r\n<p>1) When you create business cards for plastic, make sure to use a font size above 8 pt., and strokes or lines at, or above, 1.5 pt., so all elements are easy to read.</p>\r\n<p>2) Avoid including white areas and text on the design. White colored areas in your design will blend in with the material\'s clear, frosted, or white plastic background.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n<h2>Effective Ways to Design Your Plastic Business Cards</h2>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Your design will depend on the plastic material you choose and the preferred size. Here are some tips for designing your business card:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"list-style: disc;\">Larger sizes on rectangle or square designs can apply bigger and colorful images. Utilize the space to bring attention to your logo or the kind of product or service your business offers in a central image.</li>\r\n<li style=\"list-style: disc;\">Frosted and clear plastic business cards are also great alternatives to die-cut business cards, since their transparent backgrounds give the illusion of a blank space. You can make the plastic appear like an object associated with your service, such as a viewfinder for photographers, a clean window for a cleaning service, or a white canvas for an illustrator or graphic designer. </li>\r\n<li style=\"list-style: disc;\">Smaller square plastic business cards should stick to a minimalist design. This approach highlights your company name, information, and contact details. Use a color that contrasts the plastic\'s background. A bold, black font is a safe choice for all three plastic materials but you could also use more distinct shades such as navy or red. </li>\r\n<li style=\"list-style: disc;\">Stay away from light, pastel or neon colors that would fade into the plastic background.  </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>You can also check out our guide on the <a href=\"https://www.uprinting.com/blog/the-anatomy-of-business-cards-infographic/\" target=\"_blank\"> anatomy of business cards</a> and impactful ways that use <a href=\"https://www.uprinting.com/blog/the-psychology-of-business-cards/\" target=\"rel_blank\">psychology to increase the appeal of business cards</a>.</p>\r\n<h2>Choose From These Fun Shapes and Sizes</h2>\r\n<p>There are many sizes and four shapes to choose from. The <strong>rectangle and square</strong> shapes are most commonly used. A design based on these two shapes can be elevated with our 1/4\" and 1/8\" rounded corners.

We cannot add magnetic strips, sequential numbering or apply variable printing to your orders.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How thick is your 20 pt. plastic material?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Our 20 pt. material is slightly thinner than a credit card but just as durable thanks to its tearproof and waterproof qualities. It is guaranteed to last years and won\'t get destroyed as long as your customers keep the plastic business card. </p>\r\n<p><strong>How will the white areas of my design appear on a clear, frosted, and white plastic card?</strong></p>\r\n<p>All white areas in your design will blend with the plastic\'s appearance. This means white ink will appear transparent on a clear card, frosted on a semi-transparent one, and white on the opaque white material. </p>\r\n<p><strong>How can I design a plastic business card?</strong></p>\r\n<p>It\'s important to keep several design principles in mind. Make sure the information and images don\'t appear cluttered. Use colors and fonts that are easy to read. We recommend having a professional design your card or you could use our online design tool to guide you. You can request for a free file check to be sure it is free from printing errors before proceeding to print. </p>','products/Plastic_Business_3_Types_A_450x450.jpg',10,5.00,NULL,0.00,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,5.00,'lbs',NULL,NULL,1,NULL,NULL),

We also offer features that customize the carbonless forms according to your brand.</p>\r\n<h2>What Are the Different Sets Available?</h2>\r\n<p>We print your carbonless forms on 20 lb. paper that has the same lightweight and smooth writability as copy paper. The number indicates the available number of forms per set:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"list-style: disc;\"><strong>2-Part Set </strong>contains a yellow form as the extra copy.</li>\r\n<li style=\"list-style: disc;\"><strong>3-Part Set </strong>gives you two more copies of the original document on a yellow and a pink form.</li>\r\n<li style=\"list-style: disc;\"><strong>4-Part Set </strong>provides three more copies of the white form on yellow, pink, and gold forms.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>How Can I Customize My Carbonless Forms?</h2>\r\n<p>Use these features to distinguish your custom carbonless forms.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Keep things on track with sequential numbering.</strong> Adding this feature helps streamline records for data monitoring and record keeping. You can place up to 5 digits.</p>\r\n<p><strong>A glued edge determines how the set will unfold. </strong>We apply clear glue on any of the following edges on the form: <strong>top, left, right, </strong>and<strong> bottom</strong>. This keeps all the copies together for quick reference and tearing out.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Combine multiple sets with our padding options.</strong> Without the padding option, sets will arrive separated from one another. Padding glues together 25 to 50 sets in one pad either with a <strong>cardboard back </strong>or <strong>wrap-around cover</strong> (your choice).</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"list-style: disc;\">The <strong>cardboard back</strong> uses a chipboard to support several sets glued together. The backing lets you flip through the sets and provides support for the entire pad.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"list-style: disc;\">The <strong>wrap-around cover</strong>, as its name indicates, wraps around from the back to the front of the pad. You can also place the cover between sets to prevent marking from separate forms.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nGet in touch with us today and make the most out of our carbonless form printing services. Use our available templates to start customizing your own NCR form. You can also upload a file on our online calculator. Be sure to select our free file check offer so you can review everything before printing.\r\n<h2>Q&A</h2>\r\n<p><strong>What is carbonless paper and how does it work?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Carbonless forms are also known as no carbon required (NCR) forms. Without the use of carbon paper, they make duplicate copies of a handwritten or type document. Microcapsules of ink in each sheet transfer the original imprint.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Why should I print customized carbonless forms?</strong></p>\r\n<p>A customized carbonless form gives customers a professional impression of your business. The business forms you hand out are less likely to appear generic and like other companies.</p>\r\n<p><strong>When can I expect my carbonless forms to arrive?</strong></p>\r\n<p>On our online calculator, you can select your preferred printing time. Expect your order to be ready in 4 business days.</p>\r\n<p>The printing time does not include shipping to your address. Select the “Estimate Shipping Cost and Delivery Date” link to find out your order\'s arrival.</p>\r\n<strong>How many pads do I get based on the number of sets ordered?</strong>\r\n<p>On our online calculator, you can specify the number of sets and the set quantity per pad. Dividing the number of sets by the number of sets per pad gives you the total amount of pads. For example, if you choose 250 sets and 25 sets per pad, that will yield 10 pads. If you select 2500 sets and 50 sets per pad, you\'ll end up with 50 pads.</p>\r\n<p> </p>','products/Carbonless_Forms_450x450.jpg',10,5.00,NULL,0.00,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,5.00,'lbs',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

There’s a good reason you keep seeing these flags during outdoor sporting events and grand openings. Unlike regular banners, teardrop flags maintain their integrity even during windy days. This makes them perfect for outdoor advertising at the beach, ski trail, or anywhere else windy conditions are expected.</p>\r\n<p>Teardrop flags come in two sizes, measured from the bottom of the base to the top of the flag: 8.6’ (33\" x 71\" flag) and 11.4’ (39\" x 93” flag), giving you a convenient, yet still truly eye-catching piece of ad space that you can carry anywhere. They are printed on a lightweight, yet durable polyester fabric and are each mounted on a pole attached to your choice of base.  Choices for bases include ground spikes, cross bases, and water weight bags. Ground spikes are ideal for securing your custom teardrop banners on sand and grass. Cross bases are excellent for indoor promotions, such as in convention halls. Water weight bags further improve on the stability of cross bases and can be used in the outdoors on hard surfaces such as concrete, or frozen ground.</p>\r\n<p>Each custom teardrop flag order comes with a flag, pole, cord, pin, ring, and a handy nylon travel bag for easy transport and storage.

This also makes them perfect for archives and private collections as well as for retail.</p>\r\n<p>If you plan to write pricing, product numbers, or other information after printing, the uncoated stock is best, as the coatings make the paper hard to write on.

They can also be used to showcase what makes each piece of jewelry unique or serve as price or gift tags.</p>\r\n<p>Are your pieces handmade? Do proceeds go to support local charities or organizations? Are there cleaning instructions customers could find useful? These are just a few examples of what you could include on your jewelry hang tags.</p>\r\n<p>To make your custom printed jewelry hang tags truly unique, we’re giving you options to set the style, size, paper type, and even provide a rounded corner option. This way, your personalized jewelry tags are just as special as your products.</p>\r\n<p>Our most popular sizes are 2” x 2” and 2” x 2.5” although our 2” x 5.375” foldable hang tags have been getting some traction (it folds down to 2” x 2.5”). As for styles, we have foldover necklace/bracelet, loop/hook earring, post/stud earring, as well as pendant and earring.</p>\r\n<p>There are also coating options available: uncoated for those who want to write on their hang tags, matte that offers some shine, gloss which adds even more, and UV coating to make those designs really pop.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Foldover tags are shipped with the top unsecured for ease of assembly. If you wish, you can staple or glue the top of the tags to better secure your jewelry.</p>','products/Jewelry_HT_v2_1400x700_450x450.jpg',10,5.00,NULL,0.00,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,5.00,'lbs',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Metallic hang tag printing uses the Akuafoil print process. This involves printing CMYK colors on top of silver pigment. The result is hang tags with gradients, semitones or any hues you need with a metallic shimmer. Metallic hang tag printing will draw the eye to any product, and is especially useful for special offers and promotions.</p>\r\n<p>Metallic hang tag printing can accent any part of your tags with metallic highlights in any color or gradient. Use foil highlights to draw eyes to your product’s call-to-action or simply to spruce up an existing design. Metallic hang tag sizes range from as small as 1.75\" x 3.5” to as large as 3.5\" x 3.5\".</p>\r\n<p>Metallic hang tags are perfect for small to large scale businesses that want to demand a little extra shimmer and shine in their hang tags to draw attention to their products and promotions.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.uprinting.com/contact-us.html\">Contact us</a> to start customizing your metallic hang tag printing.

Hang tags are often taken for granted, seen hanging off packages and clothing in stores, but they’re incredible for your branding. A custom hang tag does so much more than share your brand -- it might also be your customer’s first point of contact with your business. Velvet hang tags offer both elegance and an addictingly tactile softness and texture you simply won’t see with most hang tags. If you want customers to have positive first impressions and keep your hang tags after purchase, velvet hang tags are your best choice.</p>\r\n<p>These special custom hang tags are printed on heavyweight 16 pt. cardstock. The additional velvet lamination adds some depth, giving you hang tags that are a chunky 19 pts. in thickness, lending a luxurious look. The soft fuzz also has the effect of cutting down reflections and muting colors in a pleasant way. Velvet tags are available in sizes ranging from 1.5\" x 3.5\" (slim business card size) to 2\" x 6\" (about the size of a bookmark). Square tags sized 2\" x 2\" to 3.5\" x 3.5\" are also available.</p>\r\n<p>Velvet hang tag printing is popular for custom clothing tags, but it could also be used for premium gift tags and price tags as well. You can also use this product as an alternative to regular business cards and bookmarks.</p>\r\n<p>Order velvet soft touch hang tag printing today.</p>','products/Velvet_Hangtags[1]_450x450.jpg',10,5.00,NULL,0.00,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,5.00,'lbs',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

These boxes are popular for custom packaging for products, boxing gifts, or anything that\'s a step above a plain cardboard box. Because they are customizable, you can brand them for your business or special event. They play a dual role of packaging and advertising your business. You design them yourself, so you can include anything you like, such as photos, your company\'s logo, website, contact information and more.             <br><br> These boxes don\'t require any assembly. They are printed, scored, and glued before you receive them. They are shipped flat, and you just add the contents then tuck each end inside. For jewelry or gifts, you may want to tie a ribbon or twine around your box for an elegant finish.              <br><br> UPrinting’s custom boxes come in three high-quality cardstock options. All include full-color printing. You can order any quantity, from 250 boxes to 20,000 per order. What’s more, all our cardstock is made from sustainable sources.             <br><br> Our boxes are suitable for indirect food contact. A functional food-safe barrier such as FDA compliant bottle, paper, foil or other packaging is recommended when these boxes are used for food or other consumable products.</p>\r\n<h3>Custom Boxes Come in 3 Styles</h3>\r\n<br><strong>Straight tuck end boxes</strong> have top and bottom closure panels that tuck from the back to the front or from the front to the back. These are popular for a wide variety of products, from toys and software to cosmetics and food items.<br> <br><strong>Autolock bottom boxes</strong> are a good option for assembly lines for larger items. No packaging tape is required, since all that’s needed to secure the box bottom is to open the flattened box and push in the flaps. This can speed up packaging and reduce repetitive stress for workers.<br> <br>Lastly, we also offer <strong>snaplock bottom boxes</strong>. With these boxes, all you do is to fold the specially-cut bottom flaps in place in order to create a secure bottom for the box, no tape or glue necessary. They’re common for large-volume retail, food, and electronics packaging.<br> <br>Boxes come in sizes from 1.7\" x 1.7\" x 5\" to 2.75\" x 1.37\" x 4\". Popular sizes covered include  3\" x 3\" x 3\", 4.75\" x 4.75\" x 2.875\" and 2.75\" x 4\".<br>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<br><br></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- end product and nav --> <!-- h2{display:none} -->','products/Boxes_450x450_450x450.jpg',10,5.00,NULL,0.00,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,5.00,'lbs',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

To help you get started, check out our <a href=\"https://www.uprinting.com/blog/a-visual-guide-for-printing-custom-labels/\">visual guide on printing custom labels</a>.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Custom Label Q&A</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Does printing time include the time needed to deliver my order?</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The printing time on the online calculator refers to the number of days to produce your order. You can estimate the transit time and expected arrival of your items by clicking on the “Estimate Shipping Cost and Delivery Date” link at the bottom of the calculator. </p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What is the difference between white premium sticker paper, BOPP materials, and textured paper?</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">White premium sticker paper is best used for items that will be displayed indoors but not refrigerated. <strong>Clear, white, and silver metallic BOPP</strong> uses a paper film that protects the label from oil, chemicals, and water. BOPP is also able to withstand refrigeration. <strong>Textured paper</strong> is often used on gourmet food and wine labels for its elegant and distinct textured finish. </p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Should I use 70 lb. label paper or 4 mil. white vinyl sticker paper for my cut-to-size labels?</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>White vinyl sticker paper</strong> is best for labels that will be used outdoors as this is UV resistant and can withstand other elements. </p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The <strong>70 lb. label</strong> material is suited for items to be displayed indoors. Choose from a gloss, high gloss, or matte finish, depending on your design. Matte and gloss are both writable while the UV resistant high gloss is not.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What are the best uses for roll labels? For cut-to-size labels?</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you need to label a large quantity of items, you can place the roll into a label dispenser for quick and easy application. Cut-to-size labels work better for promotional handouts.</p>\r\n<br> <!-- /container -->','products/Custom_Label_Promotional_A_450x450.jpg',10,5.00,NULL,0.00,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,5.00,'lbs',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
